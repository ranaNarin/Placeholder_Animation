Android Content Placeholder Animation like Facebook using Shimmer

We normally use spinner loaders when the app wants to load the data from a network call. Instead of using the usual loaders, we can make the loading screen more interesting using Facebook’s Shimmer library. This library adds Shimmer effect on to any custom view that we define. You can notice this shimmer effect in Facebook’s mobile and desktop apps.

This article explains how to use the Shimmer library in your apps with an example of loading a list data from a JSON http call.
